	<p>A landing point and index of materials relating to some of my long-term projects. The files contained in the /projects/ directory of my website all pertain to projects that I do not currently have the ability to undertake, and that will probably only see the light of day (at my hands at least) in the relatively distant future, if ever.</p>
	<h4><a href="digitalempire/index.html">Digital Empire</a></h4>
	<p>An ethical fog (cloud) hosting provider of Nextcloud instances, VPSs, secure email, and more. Intended to compete directly with GSuite and Office365.</p>
	<h4><a href="terranarchive/index.html">The Distributed Archive of Terra</a></h4>
	<p>A comprehensive archive of Terran history, art, biology, and science, to be stored on Terra, Luna, Mars, and as many other locations as possible. This is indended to an effective "backup" of Earth and human civilization in the event of an extinction-level catastrophe, probably resulting from anthropogenic climate change.</p>

	<h4><a href="hitchhikersguide/index.html">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Terra</a></h4>
	<p>A small, rugged, free-and-open-source device designed to contain a vast amount of information, including maps, translation/dictionary information, and an encyclopedia (probably Wikipedia, a full copy is only about 50 Gb). It'll be sort of like a smartphone, but with properly designed hardware and running 100% free software. As you can probably tell, it's inspired by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, from Douglas Adams' fantastic book of the same name.</p>
