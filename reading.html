<!--	<h2 class = "bronzehead" >Essential Reading for the Big-Brained Homo Sapien</h2>-->
	<p>This is a list of some of the thing's I've read that contain really cool concepts. If you fancy yourself a big-brained Homo Sapien, you should read these.</p>
	<h3>Fiction</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><h3>Starship Troopers -- Robert Heinlein</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Stormlight Archives -- Brandon Sanderson</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Sovereign (Prince) -- Nicolo Machievelli</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Art of War -- Sun Tzu</h3></li>
	  <p>A timeless compilation of strategic wisdom from ancient China.</p>
	  <li><h3>The Kingkiller Chronicles -- Patrick Rothfuss</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy -- Douglas Adams</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress -- Robert Heinlein</h3></li>
	  <p>This book takes place in the 2080s and is basically about a computer engineer from Luna who narrates how he led a revolution that won independence from Terra. Unlike most revolutionary fiction, it focuses substantailly on the logistics and theory of revolution and governance, and, like the equally fantastic Starship Troopers, it spends a fair amount of time discussing political philosophy. This book also serves to showcase some interesting cultural adaptations that have occured on the moon. I find the concepts of polyandrous line marriges and tight community justice to be pretty intruiging.</p>
	  <li><h3>The Dark Tower -- Steven King</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>Have Spacesuit, Will Travel -- Robert Heinlein</h3></li>
	  <p>A freakishly intelligent teenage protagonist teaches himself about science and electronics by fixing a spacesuit before going on a bizarre and surreal inter-galactic adventure. It's basically a less existential, hard science version of The Hitchhicker's guide to the galaxy. And yes, Heinlein is one of my favorite authors. </p>
	  <li><h3>The Lords of Discipline -- Pat Conroy</h3></li>
	  <p>I'm really not sure how to describe this book. Just read it.3</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>Non-fiction, Biographies, and Science</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><h3>The Opposite of Hate -- Sally Kohn</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>Guns, Jerms, and Steel -- Jared Diamond</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Opposite of Hate -- Sally Kohn</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>Homo Deus -- Yuval Noah Harari</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>The Boy Who Harnassed the Wind --  William Kamkwamba</h3></li>
	  <p>This is the biographic story of how a poor kid in rural Malawi taught himself about physics and engineering and electronics from books at his local library then built a windmill to bring electricity into his family home. I think he got a scholarship to a fancy European school and is currently working on bringing sustainable technology to rural Africa</p>
	</ul>
	<h3>Thoughts and Philosophies</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><h3>Industrial Society and its Future -- Theodore Kaczynski</h3></li>
	  <p>Hey, the Unabomber Manifesto is interesting. </p>
	  <li><h3>The GNU Manifesto -- Richard Stallman</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	  <li><h3>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace -- John Perry Barlow</h3></li>
	  <p></p>

	</ul>
	<h3>Mythology and Ancient Culture</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><h3>The Havamal</h3></li>
	  <p></p>
	</ul>
