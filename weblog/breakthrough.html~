	<h3>The Book</h3>
	<p>
Breakthrough follows the life of Jack Andraka from his early childhood,
detailing the pressures and events that led him to invent an early
detection test for pancreatic cancer. Overall this book is extremely
accessible, it's written very well with a cohesive and easy to follow
storyline. The author explains the scientific concepts in plain
English, allowing readers who are not well versed in science to follow
along with minimal difficulty. For me, the highlight of the story was
the explanation of the scientific process that led Jack to make his
discovery. As someone who is quite poorly versed in the fields of
biology and medicine, the accessible writing style really helped. 

</p>
	<h3>The Science</h3>
	<p>In order to detect an illness you need to be able to detect its
byproducts. If you do not know its byproducts, you will not be able to
detect it. Using an article from the open-access Public Library of
Science, Jack trawled through a database of 8,000 proteins found in
various bodily fluids of Pancreatic Cancer patients. He examined each
protein through a set of criteria:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Up-regulated or down-regulated: basically, whether or not the amount
of proteins in the blood increase or decrease with disease. Because
there would be more of them, it would be easier to detect
up-regulated proteins.
	  </li>
	  <li>If the protein was sensitive to diseases other than Pancreatic
Cancer, it would not be a reliable indicator. Many of the proteins
Jack examined were poorly documented, making research in this area
quite difficult. 
</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After a few months he was able to narrow down to a set of 50 proteins
that either met the above criteria, or were insufficiently
researched. He then ran each of those through another set of criteria,
including what bodily fluids they are found in. Because one of the
original goals of Jack's research was to find a way to detect
pancreatic cancer that was both cheap and easy, the biomarker protein
would need to be found in an easily accessible bodily-fluid like blood
or urine. About half way through the list of 50, he found a protein
that fit the bill: <i>mesothelin</i>. 
</p>
	<p>Mesothelin is a protein found in very high levels in the blood of
people in the earliest, and most treatable, stages of pancreatic,
lung, or ovarian cancer. But finding a suitable protein was only half
of what had to be done. Jack still had to come up with a cheap, easy
way of detecting it. After researching various expensive and complex
detection methods, he came up with a hypothetical solution. 
</p>
	<p>Basically, he would combine carbon nanotubes with specific antibodies
to create a network that only reacts to a specific protein. When the
mesotheline reacts with the antibodies they would form an
<i>immunocomplex</i>, basically a massive protein molecule. When this large
molecule forms, it is large enough to push aside neighboring
nanotubes, causing the network to become more spread-out. This would
reduce the number of contacts between the carbon nanotubes, creating
fewer pathways in which electrons to flow. This would increase the
electrical resistance of the network, something that can be easily
measured with an ohmmeter. 
</p>
	<p>The final product consisted of a network of carbon nanotubes and
mesothelin-sensitive antibodies layed over a firm backing. A drop of
blood would be placed on it and if its electrical resistance
increased, then the doctors would know that the patient has high
levels of mesothelin in their blood, indicating the presence of lung,
ovarian, or pancreatic cancer.
