	<h3>The Book</h3>
	<p>
Breakthrough follows the life of Jack Andraka from his early childhood,
detailing the pressures and events that led him to invent an early
detection test for pancreatic cancer. Overall this book is extremely
accessible, it's written very well with a cohesive and easy to follow
storyline. The author explains the scientific concepts in plain
English, allowing readers who are not well versed in science to follow
along with minimal difficulty. For me, the highlight of the story was
the explanation of the scientific process that led Jack to make his
discovery. As someone who is quite poorly versed in the fields of
biology and medicine, the accessible writing style really helped. 

</p>
	<h3>The Science</h3>
	<p>In order to detect an illness you need to be able to detect its
byproducts. If you do not know its byproducts, you will not be able to
detect it. Using an article from the open-access Public Library of
Science, Jack trawled through a database of 8,000 proteins found in
various bodily fluids of Pancreatic Cancer patients. He examined each
protein through a set of criteria:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Up-regulated or down-regulated: basically, whether or not the amount
of proteins in the blood increase or decrease with disease. Because
there would be more of them, it would be easier to detect
up-regulated proteins.
	  </li>
	  <li>If the protein was sensitive to diseases other than Pancreatic
Cancer, it would not be a reliable indicator. Many of the proteins
Jack examined were poorly documented, making research in this area
quite difficult. 
</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After a few months he was able to narrow down to a set of 50 proteins
that either met the above criteria, or were insufficiently
researched. He then ran each of those through another set of criteria,
including what bodily fluids they are found in. Because one of the
original goals of Jack's research was to find a way to detect
pancreatic cancer that was both cheap and easy, the biomarker protein
would need to be found in an easily accessible bodily-fluid like blood
or urine. About half way through the list of 50, he found a protein
that fit the bill: <i>mesothelin</i>. 
</p>
	<p>Mesothelin is a protein found in very high levels in the blood of
people in the earliest, and most treatable, stages of pancreatic,
lung, or ovarian cancer. But finding a suitable protein was only half
of what had to be done. Jack still had to come up with a cheap, easy
way of detecting it. After researching various expensive and complex
detection methods, he came up with a hypothetical solution. 
</p>
	<p>Basically, he would combine carbon nanotubes with specific antibodies
to create a network that only reacts to a specific protein. When the
mesotheline reacts with the antibodies they would form an
<i>immunocomplex</i>, basically a massive protein molecule. When this large
molecule forms, it is large enough to push aside neighboring
nanotubes, causing the network to become more spread-out. This would
reduce the number of contacts between the carbon nanotubes, creating
fewer pathways in which electrons to flow. This would increase the
electrical resistance of the network, something that can be easily
measured with an ohmmeter. 
</p>
	<p>The final product consisted of a network of carbon nanotubes and
mesothelin-sensitive antibodies layed over a firm backing. A drop of
blood would be placed on it and if its electrical resistance
increased, then the doctors would know that the patient has high
levels of mesothelin in their blood, indicating the presence of lung,
ovarian, or pancreatic cancer. 
</p>
	<h3>Implications</h3>
	<p>When he decided that he wanted to prevent deaths by pancreatic cancer,
the first thing Jack Andraka did was go to the internet and learn
about pancreatic cancer. If I search for pancreatic cancer in Google,
the search engine he most likely used, I get over 53 million
results. The greatest thing about the internet is that it places the
knowledge of the world--sometimes literally--at your fingertips. I
think it is safe to say that if Jack had not had access to the
internet, he would never have gotten as far as he did. 
</p>
	<p>Though the internet can give the average person access to vast sums of
knowledge, most hard science is published in journals that are locked
behind paywalls. This makes it extremely difficult for the average
person--let alone a broke teenager--to gain access to actual
scientific research. After learning all he could about pancreatic
cancer on the public internet, Jack attempted to dive into the
scientific literature, but often found his way forward hindered by
paywalls. Fortunately, his parents were able to help him access some
of the information he needed, but the presence of monolithic paywalls
blocking access to scientific research could well have ended his
endeavor. 
</p>
	<p>Even when his parents capitulated and payed for an article, it was not
uncommon for it to be so thick with jargon, that Jack, a teenager
lacking in formal science education could not read it. Dense jargon is
something that I have a personal dislike for. While jargon is often
useful at conveying more complex ideas, it can impede those less
formally educated, and its gratuitous over-use (likely for the purpose
of making people sound smart) is just confusing.  
</p>
	<p>Following a vast amount of research, Jack needed a laboratory. Out of
200 emails sent, only one person offered him access to a lab. Here
again, his lack of formal training came back to bite him, almost
ruining his experiment on multiple occasions. If he had not gained
access to a lab with expensive equipment, he never would have been able
to create a working prototype. 
</p>
	<p>Following the media frenzy around his success in science fairs, the
detection method Jack Andraka had pioneered moved on to real world
testing. As of the writing of this, it is still under review by the
FDA.
