    <p>     Our civilization is built on our ability to cram massively complex computers--
	billions of transistors--into devices small enough to fit inside the pocket. Integral
	to the construction of these devices is the element silicon, which when processed
	into Silicon Dioxide, also known as Silica, may be fashioned into tiny wafers onto
      which are engraved a maze of microscopic circuits.</p>

    <p>    Silica is one of the most common compounds found on the surface of the Earth, able to come in at least 12 different crystalline forms, it is a major component of many common rocks and crystals including granite and quartz.</p>
    <p>    The process of converting silica to poly-crystalline silicon starts by extracting pure rock crystal from the Earth. Impure forms of rock crystal like amethyst or rose quartz may also be used, provided the impurities that give them color are removed first. When the Silicon Dioxide is extracted the oxygen must be removed in order to leave pure silicon behind. In order to remove the oxygen the silica is mixed with carbon and heated to 2,000 degrees Celsius. Carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product leaving the silicon to accumulate at the bottom of the furnace. This silicon is then treated with oxygen to remove impurities like calcium, leaving behind metallurgical grade silicon.</p>

    <p>    This results in mostly pure silicon, which must be further purified in order to function in electronics. First it is ground into a fine powder, which is then mixed with hydrogen chloride and heated on a fluidized bed reactor at 300 degrees Celsius. This process creates tricholrosilane, a liquid silicon compound, as well as chlorides of various impurities that the silicon may have contained. The tricholrosilane is removed from the chlorides by a process of fractional distillation, then vaporized in hydrogen at 1,000 degrees Celsius. Finally, the electronics grade silicon is collected by a heated silicon rod.</p>

    
    <p>    While extremely pure silicon has been produced, it has a poly-crystalline structure, meaning that its body is made from many crystal structures, which makes for a poor semi0conductor. In order to create mono-crystalline silicon, where the whole ingot is a single crystal, it is run through the Czochralski process. This starts when the silicon is heated to just above its melting point (1,414 degrees Celsius) in a rotating crucible. Dopant impurities like boron or phosphorus may be added to precisely modify the silicon's electrical properties. A small silicon seed crystal is dipped into the middle of the  melted silicon, rotating in the opposite direction. The crystal attracts the molten silicon from the crucible creating a boule, a rod made from a single crystal of silicon, the size of which may be altered by minutely changing temperature and rate of spin. The final result of this process is a large, mono-crystalline, pure silicon ingot that may be sliced into thin wafers, in order to etch tiny integrated circuits.</p>
