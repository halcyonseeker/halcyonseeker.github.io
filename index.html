        <h2>Whitewashed Facts About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I'm an aspiring astronaut just out of high school. In my spare time I enjoy reading and tinkering with unix-like operating systems. I have a lot of thoughts and ideas about stuff, someday I might write them down and post them here. Google is literally Hitler and airpods are destroying the planet.</p>
        <h2>Where to Find Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Email:</td>
                <td><a href="mailto:vesperous@protonmail.com">vesperous@protonmail.com</a> </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Discord:</td>

        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I've removed my shitty old GitHub Pages website and replaced with this page. It's purpose is to act as an in-between until I can self host.</p>

        <p> I'm working on learning the ins and outs of httpd and writing a few scripts to manage content with .org files. I've been putting together a fair bit of content, but it's all contained in .org fils and I haven't got the script working nicely yet.</p>
